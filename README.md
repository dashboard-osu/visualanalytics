# Data Visualization with Tableau

#### Instructors: Naleef Fareed PhD MBA, Athena Stamos, BS Fareed Lab graduate student
#### College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio

### Areas of Focus
•	Management of the data pipeline with Tableau Prep 

•	Develop fundamental skills in visualizing data with Tableau 

•	Recognize critical aspects of dashboard design for professional 

•	Hosting dashboards with Tableau Server 

### Overview

Data visualization is critical for effective scientific communication [1]. Data visualization tools encourage data decision making in different industries such as public health and information science [2]. It is important to consider choosing the type of data visualization based on the needs of the end-users [3]. Data visualization is an essential skill to transfer data into data-driven insights. The goal of our workshop is to guide both novice and expert individuals in the use of Tableau Suite (Tableau Prep, Tableau Desktop, and Tableau Server) to develop and host professional data visualizations for data-driven decision making. Participants will be provided with presentations based on the instructors’ personal experiences with dashboard development and hands-on-activities to encourage skills development. 

This workshop is organized into four modules: data visualizations for data-driven decision making, introduction to Tableau and connecting to data, exploring and visualizing data, and creating calculations and measures in Tableau. Our team will go over these concepts using datasets: The Ohio Colleges of Medicine Government Resource Center’s Ohio Opportunity Index [4] dataset and The Mother Jones’ US mass shooting dataset [5].

## Module 1

### Module 1: Data visualizations for data-driven decision making

Module 1 provides an overview on data visualizations and how visualizations can be used for data-driven decision making. We will discuss key considerations when building data visualizations such as who is the audience, what are you trying to communicate, and how to execute this plan. We prepared a hands-on activity that highlights design planning, creating visualization objectives and aims, and general visualization objectives and measures for The Mother Jones’ US mass shooting dataset.

## Module 2

### Module 2: Introduction to Tableau Prep & Connecting to Data

In this module, we will introduce Tableau Prep and learn how to connect to different data sources (e.g., Excel, SQL server) in Tableau Prep. We will learn how to import data into Tableau. We will also explore the data cleaning steps in Tableau Prep and go over basic data types (e.g., strings, dates, Boolean values), and data loading and refresh. Participants will connect and load The Mother Jones’ US mass shooting in Tableau Prep, perform basic wrangling and transformations (e.g., merges, removing duplicates, grouping values), and build a Tableau prep flow as a hands-on activity. Data for this module and the subsequent modules can be found at: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/.

## Module 3

### Module 3: Creating Calculations and Measures

Participants will be guided through using Tableau Desktop’s basic calculations and measures. We will create calculated fields and measures such as level of detail expressions and parameters. We will also go over filters and aggregations. We will use the Mother Jones’ US mass shooting dataset to create calculations and measures as part of the hands-on activity.

## Module 4

### Module 4: Exploring and Visualizing Data

Participants will learn to create and customize visualizations. We will discuss the importance of wireframing in dashboard development and go over technical skills in creating text tables, bar charts, and maps. These data visualizations can be combined to build dashboards to communicate stories to users. We will also learn how to customize data visualizations (e.g., changing colors, labels, and sorting), and go over dashboard actions in Tableau Desktop to make the dashboards interactive. We will briefly cover hosting data in Tableau Server. As part of the hands-on activity, participants will create a text table, bar chart, map, and dashboard actions which will be used to build an interactive dashboard using The Mother Jones’ US mass shooting data.

## Discussion

Data visualizations are useful tools to communicate research findings and share insights to key stakeholders [6]. Based on existing literature; data visualizations can increase one’s comprehension of the information the visualization is trying to communicate [7]. Poor data visualizations do not communicate information effectively, leaving the user confused or even distrustful of the information presented [8]. Thus, our workshop will promote awareness on data visualizations as participants will learn basic and intermediate skills in Tableau to build a dashboard. Our workshop also focuses on providing participants the skills needed to create clear and effective data visualizations so users can make well-informed decisions. We will also emphasize different ways to communicate different types of data and research questions in our workshop session. Our workshop provides participants with a foundation on data visualization for data-driven decision making, an introduction to Tableau Prep and Desktop, and hands-on activities to explore and visualize data.
